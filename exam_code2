"""
Brilliant School conducts an exam in subjects of English, Science and Mathematics.
Science exam is split up as Science Theory and Science Practical

The maximum marks for each subject is as follows : 
          -- English : 75 marks
          -- Science Theory : 75 marks
          -- Science Practical : 25 marks
          -- Science = Science Theory + Science Practical : 100 marks
          -- Mathematics : 100 marks

The pass marks for each subject is as follows :
          -- Pass marks for English : 25
          -- Pass marks for Science Theory : 25
          -- Pass marks for Science Practical : 8
          -- Pass marks for Science : 35
          -- Pass marks for Mathematics : 35

Write a Python program to collect the marks scored by a student in all the above 4 exams
Based on the marks scored by the student, grade them according to the following criteria :
          -- Grade A : if Total > 90%
          -- Grade B : if Total > 75%
          -- Fail is any score is less than pass marks
          -- Average otherwise

Note : A student who scores only Pass marks in Science Theory and Science Practical 
            will have a total of 33 [ 25 + 8 ] 
            and this still falls short of the Pass marks for Science [ 35 ]
            and is considered as Fail.
