S15Q02
Write a function that accepts 2 lists as arguments. 
Both these 2 lists must be already sorted in the ascending order
This function should combine the lists into a sorted order and return the resulting list. 
This function should not use any built-in sort function or method.

- Write a test function that will test that the sorted list is correct. 

After successfully testing your program, 
    pass the following 2 lists as arguments to your function 
    and print the sorted result.

    - left  = [4, 17, 21, 47, 69, 75, 91, 97]
   - right = [3, 10, 11, 14, 18, 21, 44, 55, 76,97]
