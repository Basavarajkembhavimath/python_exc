"""
S06Q03 : Beach Cricket Match
     - Collect the names of the 2 batmen currently playing. 
              Who among them is currently at the non strikerâ€™s end ?
          - Collect runs scored for each ball. 
              Make sure, you accumulate runs for the correct player 
                   based on who is facing the ball.
          - Remember that players change positions at the end of each over. 
          - The match ends after 30 balls, or 
               - if any batsman scores more than 60 runs.
          - Print all the statistics for each batsman 
               as was done for the earlier T20 match [ S06Q02 ]
