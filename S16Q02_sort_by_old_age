Write a Python program that prompts the user for a file. 
This file contains names of people and their ages. 

Read the file, and print the list with the oldest personâ€™s name listed first. 
A sample file [ AGES.TXT ] is shown above :

"""
def sec(x):
    return int(x[1])
def main():
    a = input("Enter your file name :")
    old_age_names = dict()
    name_age = []
    with open(a) as file:
        FH = file.readlines()
        for i in FH :
            s = i.strip()
            splt = s.split('=')
            name_age.append(splt)
        name_age.sort(key = sec)
        print("sorted based on age in assending order")
        for j in name_age:
            print(j)
            old_age_names[j[0]] = int(j[1])
        print("listed names based on oldest age")
        for i in sorted(old_age_names,key = old_age_names.get,reverse=1):
            print(i,'-',old_age_names[i])

    
main()
