S11Q03
Write a Python script that takes a file name as its first argument. 
Create a copy of the contents of this file satisfying the following conditions :
   
   - If the file name is “file.txt”,
       then the name of the new file should be “file-new.txt”
   - Every even line of the first file, should be
       repeated in the new file.
   - The first line of the first line, should be
       repeated after the last line of the first file.
   - A sample input and output file is shown below
