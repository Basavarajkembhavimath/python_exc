with open("password.txt") as file:
    FH = file.readlines()
    user = {}
    user_id= []
    for i in FH:
        strp = i.strip()
        strp = strp.split(":")
        user_id.append(strp)
    user_id.sort(key = sec)
    for i in user_id:
        lst = ':'+i[2]+':'+i[3]+':'+i[4]+':'+i[5]+':'+i[6]
        user[i[0]] = lst
    for i in user:
        print(i,user[i])
